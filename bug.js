This bug occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a remote image URL that returns a 404 error.  The standard error handling within Expo doesn't always catch this, leading to a silent failure where the image simply doesn't render, and there are no console errors or warnings to help with debugging.  This makes it tricky to identify the source of the problem, especially in complex UIs.
